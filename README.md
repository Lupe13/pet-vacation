# HOW IT´S MADE:

Our backend allows users to register and order products.

Frontend uses angular and with JWT we do the authentication and authorization.

All services are tested.


# TOOLS:

- JAVA
- Spring Boot
- JWT
- MySQL


#TEAM

We are a group of enthusiastic coders excited about web-designing.

#OPTIMIZATIONS

- Code needs some refactoring and clean up.

- Use Swagger for API documentation.

- A new entity for orders will make it easier to organize. One of the branches has it halfway done.

- Add a search for food name, it should be easy.


#Lessons Learned:

When deploying to heroku we had to move from MySQL to Postgres.

When building JWT token, we forgot a few fields that we needed on our frontend so we had to do that later.

A good planning helps speed things up.
